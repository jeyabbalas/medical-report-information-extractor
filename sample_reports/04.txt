SPECIMENS:

A. Wide local excision, left breast
B. Sentinel lymph node, left axilla
C. Palpable lymph node, left axilla
D. Additional margin, left breast
E. Deep shave, left breast
CLINICAL DETAILS:

17mm Grade 3 invasive lobular carcinoma, left breast. Wide local excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy performed.

MACROSCOPY:

A. Wide local excision, left breast - A piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 50x40x30mm. The specimen is inked: blue for the anterior margin, red for the posterior margin, yellow for the lateral margin, and green for the medial margin. A firm, irregular mass measuring 17x13x11mm is identified in the central area.
B. Sentinel lymph node, left axilla - A piece of fibro-fatty tissue measuring 22x16x12mm. On bisection, a single lymph node is identified, OSNA negative.
C. Palpable lymph node, left axilla - Fibro-fatty tissue measuring 19x14x9mm, containing one palpable lymph node.
D. Additional margin, left breast - Additional breast tissue measuring 18x14x6mm, inked black.
E. Deep shave, left breast - Breast tissue measuring 27x22x11mm, inked orange. Serially sliced and all sections taken.

MICROSCOPY:

A. Sections show a 17mm grade 3 invasive lobular carcinoma (T3, P3, M2). The tumor is 3mm from the anterior margin and 4mm from the posterior margin. No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is observed. The carcinoma is associated with high-grade DCIS. ER positive (Q score 7/8), PR positive (Q score 5/8), HER-2 negative.
B. Sections show a single lymph node with reactive changes. No evidence of metastatic malignancy (0/1).
C. Sections show a single lymph node with reactive changes. No evidence of metastatic malignancy (0/1).
D. Sections show fibrocollagenous and fibro-fatty tissue with no evidence of malignancy.
E. Sections show fibrocollagenous and fibro-fatty tissue with occasional benign breast glands. No evidence of malignancy.

CONCLUSION:

A. Wide local excision of left breast - 17mm grade 3 invasive lobular carcinoma

3mm from anterior margin
4mm from posterior margin
Associated high-grade DCIS
B. Sentinel lymph node, left axilla - No evidence of metastatic malignancy (0/1)
C. Palpable lymph node, left axilla - No evidence of metastatic malignancy (0/1)
D. Additional margin, left breast - No evidence of malignancy
E. Deep shave, left breast - No evidence of malignancy
