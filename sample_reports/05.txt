SPECIMENS:
A. Breast Mastectomy, Left
B. Axillary Lymph Node Sample, Left

Pathologist: Dr. Jonathan Edwards
Date Received: 25/08/2024

SPECIMEN A
Side: Left
Specimen Type: Simple mastectomy
Specimen radiograph provided: Yes
Specimen weight: 800 gm
Ellipse of skin: 220 x 120 mm
Nipple: Involved by tumor
Fibro fatty tissue: 190 x 180 x 60 mm
Lesion location: Upper inner quadrant

Tumor A
A well-defined lesion measuring 30 mm superior to inferior x 35 mm medial to lateral x 25 mm anterior to posterior.
Distance from nipple: 20 mm
Blue = anterior.

Tumor B
8 mm superior to tumor A is a 12 mm nodule.

Tumor C
18 mm superior to tumor A and medial to tumor B, measuring 20 mm (SI) x 19 mm (AP) x 16 mm (ML). No nodes seen.

SPECIMEN B - AXILLARY LYMPH NODE SAMPLE, LEFT
Three pieces of fatty tissue up to 20 mm in maximum extent.

FINAL PATHOLOGY: Malignant Invasive
Main Category:
There are three invasive ductal carcinomas. Allowing for differences in fixation, the morphology is similar.

Invasive Carcinoma Size:
A = 30 mm, B = 12 mm, C = 20 mm
Whole tumor (DCIS + invasive carcinoma) size:
A = 30 mm, B = 12 mm, C = 20 mm
Extent: Multiple foci
Grade: 2 (T2, P2, M2)
Mitotic count:
A = 35, B = 25, C = 20 Mitoses/10 high power fields.
Cut offs for M2: 11 and M3: 22.

Tumor Type:
Vascular invasion: Definite around tumors A and C, but retraction artifact hampers interpretation.
Associated DCIS: Moderate
DCIS grade: Intermediate
DCIS architecture: Cribriform, micropapillary
DCIS necrosis: No
Lobular neoplasia present: No
Radial scar in continuity with cancer (benign glands in fibroelastotic stroma): Yes
Paget's disease present: Yes

Excision Status mastectomy specimen: Incomplete
Stage: 2
Lymph nodes sampled: Yes
Number of axillary nodes sampled (including apical nodes): 3
Number of axillary nodes containing tumor (including apical nodes): 1
Apical nodes sampled: Yes
Nottingham Prognostic Index: 4.0
