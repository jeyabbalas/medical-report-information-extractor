        "Assign 'QS': if the report mentions that it is reporting an Allred score or a quick score (QS) for ER status. Its value ranges from 0-8. Note 1: if the score for ER status is reported as a fraction out of 8 without mentioning the score type (e.g. 7/8) assume that it is reporting an Allred score, and assign 'QS'. Note 2: if the score for ER status is reported as an integer, the integer is between 0 and 8, and the report does not specify any of the ER score types listed here, assume that it is reporting an Allred score and assign 'QS'. Note 3: if a quick/Allred score is being reported in conjunction with other component scores (i.e. percentage of positive cells and intensity of staining) choose the quick/Allred score, and therefore assign 'QS'.",
        "Assign 'IP': if the report mentions that it is reporting a H-score or a combined score obtained by multiplying the intensity of staining and the percentage of positive cells for ER status.

Note: if a Mitch Dowsett score is being reported in conjunction with other component scores (i.e. percentage of positive cells and intensity of staining) choose the Mitch Dowsett score, and therefore assign 'MD'.",
        "Assign 'I': if the report only mentions the intensity of staining for ER status and does not mention any derived scores (i.e. quick/Allred score, H-score/combined score, Mitch Dowsett score). This case is unusual. Its value ranges from 0-3. Note: if the intensity of staining is being reported for ER status in conjunction with a derived score (i.e. quick/Allred score, H-score/combined score, Mitch Dowsett score) choose the derived score, and do not assign 'I'.",

This case is unusual. Its value ranges from 0-100%. Note: if the percentage of positive cells is being reported for ER status in conjunction with a derived score (i.e. quick/Allred score, H-score/combined score, Mitch Dowsett score) choose the derived score, and do not assign 'P'.",
