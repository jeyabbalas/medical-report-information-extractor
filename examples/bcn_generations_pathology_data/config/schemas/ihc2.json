      "description": "If the pathology report specifies a immunohistochemistry (IHC) score to determine the HER2 status, extract and assign the value to this variable. The IHC score is typically reported as 0, 1+, 2+, or 3+. The same scores may sometimes be represented as fractions, such as 0/3, 1/3, 2/3, and 3/3. In this case, map them to the corresponding values from the enum list i.e., 0, 1+, 2+, and 3+, respectively, before assigning it to this variable. The score may sometimes be represented using a shorthand notation, such as '+++' to indicate a score of 3+. Here again, map them to the corresponding value in the enum list. Assign null: if the HER2 IHC score is not specified in the report or if the report mentions that the HER2 IHC test is not applicable (N/A) to the patient. Note 1: expect typographical errors and sentence alignment errors typical in documents generated using optical character recognition. For example, a HER2 IHC score of 9 is unlikely and should be interpreted as the similar looking 0. Note 2: if multiple HER2 IHC scores are specified in the report, the score in the conclusion section should be preferred.",
