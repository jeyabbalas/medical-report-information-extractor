Requesting Clinician: Dr. Anna Garcia
Location: Outpatients Breast Clinic

SPECIMENS:
Left mastectomy
Sentinel lymph node (A)
Sentinel lymph node (B)
Palpable nodes left axilla

CLINICAL DETAILS:
The patient presents with a recurring rash on the left nipple. Imaging via mammography and ultrasound detected four suspicious lesions in the upper quadrant of the left breast. The left axillary lymph node appeared slightly enlarged. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the left breast revealed atypical cells suggestive of malignancy (C3), while the axillary lymph node was benign (C1). Core biopsy confirmed an invasive lobular carcinoma, grade III, along with high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the solid type with necrosis. HER-2 status was positive.

MACROSCOPY:
1. Left mastectomy
A specimen measuring 19cm LM x 13cm SI x 9cm AP, weighing 1320g. The anterior surface included an ellipse of skin measuring 19cm x 13cm, with the nipple noted to be erythematous and crusted. A suture was marked at the 10 o'clock position. The specimen was inked blue superiorly and black inferiorly. It was serially sectioned into six slices, with slice 1 being the most anterior.

Largest lesion (Lesion 1): Located in slices 3, 4, and 5, this lesion appeared as a single mass with irregular margins, measuring 4.5cm in maximum dimension, extending to within 0.5cm of the superior resection margin.
Second lesion (Lesion 2): Situated superomedially to Lesion 1, measuring 1.2cm in maximum dimension, 1cm from the superior margin.
Third lesion (Lesion 3): Located 4cm inferolaterally to Lesion 1, measuring 1.1cm, 4.5cm from the superior margin.
Fourth lesion (Lesion 4): In slice 3, 3cm medially to Lesion 1, measuring 0.9cm, 3.5cm from the superior and medial margins.
Fifth lesion (Lesion 5): In slice 4, 3.5cm inferior to Lesion 1, measuring 1.4cm, 5.5cm from the superior margin.
Blocks taken:

A & B: Transection of Lesion 1 to the superior margin
C: Lesion 2 to the superior margin
D: Lesion 3
E: Lesion 4 to the medial margin
F: Lesion 5
G: Lesion 1 to the posterior margin cruciate
H: Nipple cruciate
I: Background upper outer quadrant
J: Background lower outer quadrant
K: Lower inner quadrant
L: Upper inner quadrant
2. Sentinel lymph node (A)
A piece of fibrofatty tissue containing two palpable lymph nodes, measuring 1.3cm x 0.9cm and 1.7cm x 1.0cm x 0.8cm. The first node was serially sectioned and placed in cassette A, and the second node was also serially sectioned and embedded in cassette B.

3. Sentinel lymph node (B)
A sample of fibrofatty tissue, 2.0cm x 1.4cm x 0.7cm, containing two palpable lymph nodes (1.1cm x 0.5cm x 0.5cm and 0.7cm in maximum dimension). The larger node was serially sectioned and embedded in cassette A, and the smaller node was embedded intact in cassette B.

4. Palpable nodes left axilla
Two pieces of fibrofatty tissue, measuring 1.2cm x 1.1cm x 0.6cm (embedded intact in cassette A) and 2.2cm x 1.3cm x 0.6cm containing a palpable node, 0.8cm in maximum dimension (bisected in cassette B).

MICROSCOPY:
1. Sections from the left mastectomy
Show grade 3 invasive lobular carcinoma, measuring 45mm, associated with high-grade DCIS. Tumor cells infiltrate in single file patterns and form targetoid periductal arrangements. ER and PR status negative, HER-2 positive (+++). No evidence of lymphovascular invasion. Margins are clear: 5mm superior, 7mm posterior.

2. Sentinel lymph node (A)
Shows metastatic carcinoma in 2 of 2 nodes.

3. Sentinel lymph node (B)
Shows no evidence of metastatic carcinoma in 2 nodes.

4. Palpable nodes left axilla
Reveals metastatic carcinoma in 1 of 1 node.

CONCLUSION:
Left mastectomy
Grade 3 invasive lobular carcinoma, 45mm, with high-grade DCIS. Clear surgical margins.
Sentinel lymph node (A)
Metastatic carcinoma in both nodes.
Sentinel lymph node (B)
No metastatic carcinoma.
Palpable nodes left axilla
Metastatic carcinoma in one node.
Total nodal count: 5
