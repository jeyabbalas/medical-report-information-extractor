The T stage can be any of the following: 'TX', 'T0', 'Tis', 'T1', 'T1mi', 'T1a', 'T1b', 'T1c', 'T2', 'T3', 'T4', 'T4a', 'T4b', 'T4c', 'T4d'. It may optionally be prefixed by 'c' to indicate clinical staging (e.g., 'cT1', 'cT1b', 'cT3', etc.) or 'p' to indicate pathological staging (e.g., 'pTis', 'pT1c', 'pT2', etc.). It may also optionally be prefixed by 'y' to indicate post-therapy staging (e.g., 'ypT1a', 'ypT4', etc.). It may optionally be suffixed by '(m)' to indicate multiple primary tumours (e.g., 'pT1(m)', 'ypT3(m)', etc.) or '(mic)' for microinvasion (e.g., 'pT1c(mic)', 'ypT1(mic)', etc.). Extract the T stage specified in the report, and assign to this variable the most appropriate T stage that is consistent with the described pattern. Format the extracted string, if necessary. Assign null: if no T stage is explicitly assigned by the pathologist in the report. Note 1: If the pathologist does not assign a T stage, do not infer it on your own; simply assign null instead. Note 2: Expect the report to contain typographical errors from OCR and always conform to the list of possible T stages given here. Note 3: Sometimes tubule formation scores (for grading) may seem similar to some of the T stages (T1, T2, T3), in which case ignore them because grades are not the same as stages. Grading is often written in TPM triplets e.g. (T3, P2, M1). Ignore grades.",
